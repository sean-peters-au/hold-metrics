# Hold Metrics

The intention is to capture a variety of load sensors behind a climbing hold and use that to visualise the forces a climber places on holds while climbing.

Right now it just lets you configure, zero, calibrate and visualise 1D force on N load sensors.

### Instructions

1. Upload `server.ino` to your arduino
2. Install requirements
```
pipenv shell
pipenv sync
```
3. Run the app
```
python main.py
```
